# The Historical Significance of International Trade


## Introduction

Throughout history, international trade has always been a relevant matter. This was very apparent during the 20th century because there were many significant events that took place which began to shape American’s perspective on international trade. The focus on international trade began between 1895 and 1915 when the United States transformed from an isolationist country into a world empire. This transformation resulted in the U.S having an active influence on the affairs of countries located overseas. To understand the relevance of international trade it is useful to explore (1) the significant history of tariffs in the United States, (2) The Great Depression and resulting Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, and (3) WW2 era and the establishment of the 1947 GATT.

## History of tariffs in United States

With international trade, tariffs have a long-lasting impact primarily on consumers since tariffs are typically used to restrict imports. This results in the increase of the price of goods and services purchased from another country, which makes them less appealing to domestic consumers. The history of tariffs in the United States, really starts to develop when Congress first signed into law the Tariff Act of 1789.

Tyler Halloran, in the article titled “A Brief History of Tariffs in the United States and the Dangers of their Use Today” (2019)[^1], suggests that the Tariff Act of 1789 had two major purposes. Its first was to promote free trade by placing France and Great Britain on an equal footing when it came to shipping, manufacturing and raw products delivered to American ports. The second was to raise revenue for the federal government of the United States. Alexander Hamilton was a strong supporter of the 1789 Tariff Act as that he viewed the act as having a significant role in protecting the American manufacturing industries from foreign competition and promoting industrial growth over the long run. However, as Halloran indicates, due to the industrial expansion that occurred in the late 1800’s and the adoption of the income tax in the early 1900’s, this had “undermined the historical justification of the 1789 tariff.” (Halloran). As a result, the 1789 Tariff Act would eventually set the precedent for other tariff acts in the 20th century including the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act.

## The Great Depression and resulting Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act

Before exploring the effects that the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act had on international trade during the 20th century, it’s important to understand the influence of the Great Depression in the formation of this act. The Great Depression was a global economic crisis that occurred from 1929 to 1933. During this time unemployment and lower wages made personal earnings decrease nationwide from eighty-seven billion to forty billion dollars. In addition, approximately five thousand banks failed between 1929 and 1933 and many people lost their life savings. In order to solve this problem, the American people turned to president Herbert Hoover for potential solutions. Hoover believed that we needed a balanced federal budget and that public relief to citizens would “make them dependent and undermine free enterprise.” (Gilmore, Sugrue). He tried to solve this crisis by creating the Federal Farm Board to buy farm surpluses in the hopes of stopping the decrease in prices. However, this strategy did not function as Hoover had planned because farmers actually increased their production and produced more surplus, which decreased prices even further. As a result, in 1930 congress passed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act.

The purpose of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act was to protect American industries and farmers by raising import duties. David A. Lake, in the book “Power, Protection, and Free Trade” (1988) [^2], indicates that even though the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act contained the highest duty rates in American history, these rates were typically evaluated on a small range of goods and services. As a result, the duty levels on all imports were lower in the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act compared to previous tariffs that were passed during earlier phases of American trade strategy. Four years after the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act was created, an additional Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act was created which resulted in significant policy change by giving the president more power in tariff making authority. This act reversed the projection towards higher tariffs and worked to promoted cooperation with foreign governments and American exports. This pattern for tariff reduction was the precursor to the 1947 General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), an international trade agreement signed by twenty-three countries, including Canada.

## WW2 era and the establishment of the 1947 GATT

Francine McKenzie, in the book “Planning In Cold War Europe” (2018), states that the purpose of the GATT was to promote trade liberalization by lowering tariffs. As part of the agreement, each member of the GATT was expected to conduct equal trade with other participating countries thus removing trade discrimination. In addition, the GATT significantly reduced tariffs on industrial goods from forty percent in 1947 to less than five percent by 1993. The GATT also played an important role during the Cold war, which began after WWII. Bruce W.  Wilkinson, in the article “General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)”,(2006) states that this agreement had “helped the U.S.-led capitalist west spread its influence by liberalizing trade through multilateral trade agreements.” (Wilkerson). Creating these trade agreements allowed western nations to strengthen their global influence as they were facing the growing threat of communism during the cold war. After the Cold War, the GATT transitioned into a global organization known as the World Trade Organization (WTO) which came into effect on January 1st, 1995. As of October 2020, 164 countries were members of the WTO and 23 countries were in the process of joining.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, international trade continues to be an important topic even after the 20th century. From the history of tariffs in the United States to the WWII era and the establishment of the 1947 GATT, international trade has continually evolved and remains a relevant aspect in our daily lives. Although we no longer face the growing threat of communism that sprung from the cold war era, it’s important that we continue to strengthen our global influence and create free trade through multilateral trade agreements. By doing this, we not only develop stronger relationships with our allies around the world, we also become better equipped to handle crises at home and abroad.
