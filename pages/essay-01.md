# The Historical Significance of International Trade


## Introduction

Throughout history, international trade has always been a relevant matter. This was very apparent during the 20th century because there were many significant events that took place which began to shape American’s perspective on international trade. The focus on international trade began between 1895 and 1915 when the United States transformed from an isolationist country into a world empire. This transformation resulted in the U.S having an active influence on the affairs of countries located overseas. To understand the relevance of international trade it is useful to explore (1) the significant history of tariffs in the United States, (2) The Great Depression and resulting Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, and (3) WW2 era and the establishment of the 1947 GATT.



## History of tariffs in United States

With international trade, tariffs have a long-lasting impact primarily on consumers since tariffs are typically used to restrict imports. This results in the increase of the price of goods and services purchased from another country, which makes them less appealing to domestic consumers. The history of tariffs in the United States, really starts to develop when Congress first signed into law the Tariff Act of 1789.

Tyler Halloran, in the article titled “A Brief History of Tariffs in the United States and the Dangers of their Use Today” (2019)[^1], suggests that the Tariff Act of 1789 had two major purposes. Its first was to promote free trade by placing France and Great Britain on an equal footing when it came to shipping, manufacturing and raw products delivered to American ports. The second was to raise revenue for the federal government of the United States. Alexander Hamilton was a strong supporter of the 1789 Tariff Act as that he viewed the act as having a significant role in protecting the American manufacturing industries from foreign competition and promoting industrial growth over the long run. However, as Halloran indicates, due to the industrial expansion that occurred in the late 1800’s and the adoption of the income tax in the early 1900’s, this had “undermined the historical justification of the 1789 tariff.” (Halloran). As a result, the 1789 Tariff Act would eventually set the precedent for other tariff acts in the 20th century including the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act.
