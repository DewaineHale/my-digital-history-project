# The Historical Significance of International Trade


## Introduction

Throughout history, international trade has always been a relevant matter. This was very apparent during the 20th century because there were many significant events that took place which began to shape American’s perspective on international trade. The focus on international trade began between 1895 and 1915 when the United States transformed from an isolationist country into a world empire. This transformation resulted in the U.S having an active influence on the affairs of countries located overseas. To understand the relevance of international trade it is useful to explore (1) the significant history of tariffs in the United States, (2) The Great Depression and resulting Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, and (3) WW2 era and the establishment of the 1947 GATT.

## History of tariffs in United States

With international trade, tariffs have a long-lasting impact primarily on consumers since tariffs are typically used to restrict imports. This results in the increase of the price of goods and services purchased from another country, which makes them less appealing to domestic consumers. 
The history of tariffs in the United States, starts to develop when George Washington first signed into law the Tariff Act of 1789, not long after the Boston Tea Party, which was a mercantile protest against the British East India Company for selling tea from China in American colonies without paying additional import taxes. The act was a key piece of legislation in promoting industrial growth, contributing to 95% of federal government revenue.

## The Tariff Act of 1789

{% include feature/pdf.html filename="Tariff of 1789.pdf" caption="Tariff Act of 1789" link="https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1819831.pdf" %}

In the journal article titled “Protective Purpose of the Tariff Act of 1789 [^1]” by William Hill, the author describes the tariff as a revenue measure against England, who were trying to create a monopoly of commodities used for American imports. This angered Americans because they wanted the freedom of creating commodities domestically instead of importing from England. In response, Congress decided to take protective measures to protect this freedom by creation of the tariff act. The Tariff Act of 1789 was created as an urgent temporary revenue measure until a comprehensive system could be arranged. The duties on imported commodities were limited to those which were readily produced in the United States and the list continued to be developed as additional tariffs were created.



Over the next 150 years, additional tariff acts would follow. Some of these include The Embargo Act of 1807, The Tariff of Abominations of 1828, The Underwood Tariff of 1913 and Smoot Hawley Tariff of 1930.

## The Embargo Act of 1807

{% include feature/pdf.html filename="The 1807-1809 Embargo Against Great Britain.pdf" caption="1807-1809 Embargo against Great Britain" link="https://www-jstor-org.uidaho.idm.oclc.org/stable/2120129?seq=1" %}

In the Journal article titled “The 1807-1809 Embargo Against Great Britain [^2]” by Jeffery A. Frankel, the author describes the 1807 embargo act as an attempt by President Thomas Jefferson to prohibit American ships from trading in all foreign ports.  The purpose of this act was to persuade Great Britain and France to abandon their policies of seizing neutral American ships. The embargo was precipitated by Napoleon Bonaparte’s 1806 Berlin Decree, which forbade the import of British goods into European countries dependent upon France. Jefferson hoped that the Embargo act of 1807 would prevent a war between the U.S. and Great Britain. However, the Embargo Act of 1807 would eventually fail and in 1809, after Federalist Party opposition to Jefferson the embargo was abolished. As Frankel implies in the article, the commonly thought reason for the embargo failure was due to lack of economic power from the United States and that the implications of the embargo were much greater to the U.S. than Great Britain. Frankel’s argument is that the historical data, however shows that the United States was in a better economic condition under the embargo in comparison to Great Britain and that the reason for the failure of the embargo was for political discourse between Federalists and Republicans. 

## The Tariff of Abominations of 1828

{% include feature/pdf.html filename="The Tariff of Abominations_ The Effects _ US House of Representatives_ History, Art & Archives.pdf" caption="The Tariff of Abominations: The Effects" link="https://history.house.gov/Historical-Highlights/1800-1850/The-Tariff-of-Abominations/" %}

The tariff act of 1828 was signed by President John Quincy Adams to protect Northern and Western agricultural products from foreign imports. However, as noted in the article titled "The Effects of the Tariff of Abominations from the U.S. House of Representatives [^3]" history archives, the resulting tax on foreign goods would increase the cost of living in the South and decrease the profits of New England’s industrialists.  By approving the tariff act, this would help seal Adam’s loss to Andrew Jackson in the 1828 presidential election because the tariff protected northern manufactures from cheap British products, but harmed the South. In response to the tariff of 1828, vice president John Calhoun articulated the doctrine of nullification, which emphasized a state’s right to reject federal laws within its borders and questioned the constitutionality of taxing imports without raising revenue.

{% include feature/pdf.html filename="Northern Star R.I 1830.pdf" caption="Northern Star newspaper 1830" link="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83021520/1830-11-20/ed-1/seq-1/#date1=1777&sort=relevance&rows=20&words=1828+tariff&searchType=basic&sequence=0&index=4&state=&date2=1963&proxtext=tariff+of+1828&y=0&x=0&dateFilterType=yearRange&page=3" %}

The Tariff Act of 1828 had much controversy between Northern and Southern states. In the newspaper “The Rhode Island Northern Star [^4]” published in 1830, the author writes from the perspective of the Northern states and how the tariff act benefits them. For the Northern states, which were primary manufacturers of final goods, the tariff provided protection from foreign competition by imposing import fees on manufactured goods, which made foreign products more expensive and local products less expensive in comparison. The Southern states however, were producers primarily of raw materials and depended on export of the materials to foreign countries. In retaliation of the U.S. Tariff Act if 1828, foreign countries increased import taxes and the Southern states suffered economically.

## The Underwood Tariff of 1913

The Underwood Tariff of 1913 was sponsored by Alabama representative Oscar Underwood. Its main purpose was to reduce taxes on manufactured goods and eliminate duties on most raw materials. To recover the revenue lost, the act levied a graduated income tax made possible by the ratification of the sixteenth amendment which gave congress the power to collect income taxes from whichever source derived without the appointment among the states. 

{% include feature/pdf.html filename="Underwood Tariff.pdf" caption="The Day Book Oct 4, 1913" link="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045487/1913-10-04/ed-2/seq-23/#date1=1900&index=10&rows=20&words=tariff+Underwood&searchType=basic&sequence=0&state=&date2=1915&proxtext=underwood+tariff&y=12&x=18&dateFilterType=yearRange&page=1" %}

In the newspaper “The Day Book [^5]”, published October 4, 1913, the author writes about the benefits that this new tariff will have for the average consumer. The tariff, which reduced the duties on most imports, lowered the rates from around 46% to 18%. This allowed the American industry to compete internationally and as a result, the average consumer prices dropped significantly. This new tariff was very popular among the people because it provided higher quality goods at lower pricing.

## The Great Depression and resulting Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act

Before exploring the effects that the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act had on international trade during the 20th century, it’s important to understand the influence of the Great Depression in the formation of this act. The Great Depression was a global economic crisis that occurred from 1929 to 1933. During this time unemployment and lower wages made personal earnings decrease nationwide from eighty-seven billion to forty billion dollars. In addition, approximately five thousand banks failed between 1929 and 1933 and many people lost their life savings.

In desperation, the American people turned to President Herbert Hoover for potential solutions. Hoover believed that the solution was to create a balanced federal budget and provide public relief to citizens to help them become more dependent and Hoover creates the Federal Farm Board to buy farm surpluses in the hopes of stopping the decrease in prices. Unfortunately farmers increased their production and produced more surpluses, which decreased prices even further. Looking for a solution, Congress eventually passed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act in 1930 by a very small majority vote of 44 to 42 after more than 1 ½ years of debate. The act was designed to protect American industries and farmers by raising import duties at a historical level on select items, however Republican and Democratic parties could not agree on which items qualified.

{% include feature/pdf.html filename="Robber Tariff.pdf" caption="Indianapolis Times newspaper June 1930" link="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82015313/1930-06-13/ed-1/seq-1/#date1=05%2F30%2F1930&index=9&date2=06%2F30%2F1930&searchType=advanced&language=&sequence=1&words=Hawley+Smoot+Smoot-Hawley&proxdistance=5&state=&rows=20&ortext=&proxtext=&phrasetext=smoot-hawley&andtext=&dateFilterType=range&page=1" %}

In the newspaper article titled “Robber Tariff Passed By Senate [^6]”, the writer describes the high level controversy over the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act. As the writer indicates, the primary objection to the act was raised by farm Republicans and Democrats who claimed that the act fails to protect agriculture and farmers since the increased agriculture duties will be ineffective and that industrial duties will only create additional burden for the farmers.


{% include feature/pdf.html filename="Nogales International newspaper.pdf" caption="Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act Editorial" link="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn96060774/1932-08-13/ed-1/seq-2/" %}

In the Nogales International Editorial published August 13, 1932, the editorial titled “Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act [^7]”, focuses on the Imperial Conference at Ottawa, which was the British Empire Economic Conference to discuss The Great Depression and associated trade restrictions. In the article it is implied that the concept of “imperial preference” will be enacted and will result in discrimination against American manufacturers exports of essential raw materials such as coal, steel and tobacco, which would further reduce the amount of foreign commerce and any increase in the future will be lost. This article is one example of the divide between Republican and Democrat parties over international trade policy. Republicans in general favored continued high import tariffs since they proposed that this would help to save American manufacturers. Democrats argued that higher tariffs were not the right solution and that America should instead try to work cooperatively with other countries for international trade.


As a result of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, many countries enacted their own restrictive tariffs for imports, which worsened the Great Depression.  Four years after the passing of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act was created to try and alleviate the problem.

## Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act

The Reciprocal Trade Agreement Act (RTAA) was enacted in 1934 as an amendment to the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act by President Franklin Roosevelt and resulted in significant policy change by giving the president more power in tariff making authority and reducing congressional control of trade policy to reduce the influence of favored industries that provided campaign funding. This act reversed the projection towards higher tariffs as the president was empowered to work in cooperation with international countries for mutual trade tariff reduction between America and international governments.

{% include feature/pdf.html filename="Evening Star 1936.pdf" caption="Evening Star newspaper 1936" link="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/data/batches/dlc_1iche_ver01/data/sn83045462/00280602772/1936072601/0350.pdf" %}

In the article titled “Reciprocal Trade Pact Results Indicate Boost to Commerce [8]”, which appeared in the Sunday Star newspaper dated July 1936, the writer describes how the Reciprocal Trade Act has improved the economic situation in the U.S. as the act is proving to be successful in stimulating increases in foreign export and import activities by mutual reduction of trade tariffs.

This pattern for tariff reduction is the precursor to the 1947 General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), an international trade agreement signed by twenty-three countries, including Canada.

## WW2 era and the establishment of the 1947 GATT
 
{% include feature/pdf.html filename="GATT and Cold War.pdf" caption="GATT and the Cold War" link="https://www-jstor-org.uidaho.idm.oclc.org/stable/pdf/26922776.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A0e9c779b9649763cc0ca2c916687b6f1&ab_segments=0%2Fbasic_phrase_search%2Fcontrol&origin=" %}

In the journal article titled “GATT and the Cold War [^9]”, by Francine McKenzie, the author describes how the General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) was initially intended as a provisional agreement that would be succeeded by the International Trade Organization. However, McKenzie points out that that the International Trade Organization was never established due to complicated reasons. As a result, the GATT was the main arbiter of commercial relations for nearly half a century, until it was incorporated into the World Trade Organization in 1995. The GATT’s main goal was to define and enforce rules of free trade and coordinate negotiations that were aimed at lowering tariffs and removing other trade barriers. The author also describes how the onset of the Cold War meant that the GATT operated in a world much different than the writers had imagined of the post war time.

## World Trade Organization of 1995

{% include feature/image.html filename="World_Trade_Organization-Logo.wine.png" alt="WTO 2" width="50" %}

Initially established in 1995 as a descendant from the General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the World Trade Organization mission is to establish global rules of trade between its members, which includes currently 164 countries. The purpose of this organization is to encourage prosperous and peaceful economic agreements between countries by helping to eliminate trade barriers. By all members agreeing to follow these global rules, it allows opportunities for trade rights and transparent trade policies. As a governing organization, the WTO also allows for settlement of trade disputes by independent experts. In addition, WTO also incorporates a periodic Trade Policy Review Mechanism to improve transparency and create better understanding of trade policies.

{% include feature/pdf.html filename="WTO governance.pdf" caption="World Trade Organization" link="https://academic.oup.com/ejil/article/27/1/9/2756327" %}

In the Journal article titled “The World Trade Organization 20 Years On: Global Governance by Judiciary [^10]” by Robert Howse, the author describes the many global challenges for the World Trade Organization and the effectiveness of its international judiciary system. Howse explains how the WTO judicial system was developed and the structure of the current organization. The writer also describes the short comings of the GATT and its failure in imposing economic restrictions, which is a primary reason why the World Trade Organization was formed.

## Conclusion
International trade continues to be an important topic even after the 20th century. From the history of tariffs in the United States to the WWII era, the establishment of the 1947 GATT and formation of the World Trade Organization, international trade has continually evolved and remains a relevant aspect in our daily lives. Although we no longer face the growing threat of communism that sprung from the cold war era, it’s important that we continue to strengthen our global influence and create free trade through multilateral trade agreements. By doing this, we not only develop stronger relationships with our allies around the world, we also become better equipped to handle crises at home and abroad.
