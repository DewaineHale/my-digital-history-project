# The Historical Significance of International Trade


## Introduction

Throughout history, international trade has always been a relevant matter. This was very apparent during the 20th century because there were many significant events that took place which began to shape American’s perspective on international trade. The focus on international trade began between 1895 and 1915 when the United States transformed from an isolationist country into a world empire. This transformation resulted in the U.S having an active influence on the affairs of countries located overseas. To understand the relevance of international trade it is useful to explore (1) the significant history of tariffs in the United States, (2) The Great Depression and resulting Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, and (3) WW2 era and the establishment of the 1947 GATT.

## History of tariffs in United States

With international trade, tariffs have a long-lasting impact primarily on consumers since tariffs are typically used to restrict imports. This results in the increase of the price of goods and services purchased from another country, which makes them less appealing to domestic consumers. 
The history of tariffs in the United States, starts to develop when George Washington first signed into law the Tariff Act of 1789, not long after the Boston Tea Party, which was a mercantile protest against the British East India Company for selling tea from China in American colonies without paying additional import taxes. The act was a key piece of legislation in promoting industrial growth, contributing to 95% of federal government revenue. 
Over the next 150 years, various tariff acts would follow. A partial listing includes **The Embargo Act of 1807**, **The Tariff of Abominations of 1828**, **The Underwood Tariff of 1913** and **Smoot Hawley Tariff of 1930**.

Tyler Halloran, in the article titled “A Brief History of Tariffs in the United States and the Dangers of their Use Today” (2019)[^1], suggests that the Tariff Act of 1789 had two major purposes. Its first was to promote free trade by placing France and Great Britain on an equal footing when it came to shipping, manufacturing and raw products delivered to American ports. The second was to raise revenue for the federal government of the United States. Alexander Hamilton was a strong supporter of the 1789 Tariff Act as that he viewed the act as having a significant role in protecting the American manufacturing industries from foreign competition and promoting industrial growth over the long run. However, as Halloran indicates, due to the industrial expansion that occurred in the late 1800’s and the adoption of the income tax in the early 1900’s, this had “undermined the historical justification of the 1789 tariff.” (Halloran).
## The Embargo Act of 1807

{% include feature/pdf.html filename="The 1807-1809 Embargo Against Great Britain.pdf" caption="1807-1809 Embargo against Great Britain" link="https://www-jstor-org.uidaho.idm.oclc.org/stable/2120129?seq=1" %}

In the Journal article titled “The 1807-1809 Embargo Against Great Britain” by Jeffery A. Frankel, the author describes the 1807 embargo act as an attempt by President Thomas Jefferson to prohibit American ships from trading in all foreign ports.  The purpose of this act was to persuade Great Britain and France to abandon their policies of seizing neutral American ships. The embargo was precipitated by Napoleon Bonaparte’s 1806 Berlin Decree, which forbade the import of British goods into European countries dependent upon France. Jefferson hoped that the Embargo act of 1807 would prevent a war between the U.S. and Great Britain. However, the Embargo Act of 1807 would eventually fail and in 1809, after Federalist Party opposition to Jefferson the embargo was abolished. As Frankel implies in the article, the commonly thought reason for the embargo failure was due to lack of economic power from the United States and that the implications of the embargo were much greater to the U.S. than Great Britain. Frankel’s argument is that the historical data, however shows that the United States was in a better economic condition under the embargo in comparison to Great Britain and that the reason for the failure of the embargo was for political discourse between Federalists and Republicans. 

## The Tariff of Abominations of 1828

{% include feature/pdf.html filename="The Tariff of Abominations_ The Effects _ US House of Representatives_ History, Art & Archives.pdf" caption="The Tariff of Abominations: The Effects" link="https://history.house.gov/Historical-Highlights/1800-1850/The-Tariff-of-Abominations/" %}

The tariff act of 1828 was signed by President John Quincy Adams to protect Northern and Western agricultural products from foreign imports. However, as noted in the article titled "The Effects of the Tariff of Abominations from the U.S. House of Representatives" history archives, the resulting tax on foreign goods would increase the cost of living in the South and decrease the profits of New England’s industrialists.  By approving the tariff act, this would help seal Adam’s loss to Andrew Jackson in the 1828 presidential election because the tariff protected northern manufactures from cheap British products, but harmed the South. In response to the tariff of 1828, vice president John Calhoun articulated the doctrine of nullification, which emphasized a state’s right to reject federal laws within its borders and questioned the constitutionality of taxing imports without raising revenue.

{% include feature/pdf.html filename="Northern Star R.I 1830.pdf" caption="Northern Star newspaper 1830" link="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83021520/1830-11-20/ed-1/seq-1/#date1=1777&sort=relevance&rows=20&words=1828+tariff&searchType=basic&sequence=0&index=4&state=&date2=1963&proxtext=tariff+of+1828&y=0&x=0&dateFilterType=yearRange&page=3" %}

The Tariff Act of 1828 had much controversy between Northern and Southern states. In the newspaper “The Rhode Island Northern Star” published in 1830, the author writes from the perspective of the Northern states and how the tariff act benefits them. For the Northern states, which were primary manufacturers of final goods, the tariff provided protection from foreign competition by imposing import fees on manufactured goods, which made foreign products more expensive and local products less expensive in comparison. The Southern states however, were producers primarily of raw materials and depended on export of the materials to foreign countries. In retaliation of the U.S. Tariff Act if 1828, foreign countries increased import taxes and the Southern states suffered economically.

## The Underwood Tariff of 1913

The Underwood Tariff of 1913 was sponsored by Alabama representative Oscar Underwood. Its main purpose was to reduce taxes on manufactured goods and eliminate duties on most raw materials. To recover the revenue lost, the act levied a graduated income tax made possible by the ratification of the sixteenth amendment which gave congress the power to collect income taxes from whichever source derived without the appointment among the states. 

{% include feature/pdf.html filename="Underwood Tariff.pdf" caption="The Day Book Oct 4, 1913" link="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045487/1913-10-04/ed-2/seq-23/#date1=1900&index=10&rows=20&words=tariff+Underwood&searchType=basic&sequence=0&state=&date2=1915&proxtext=underwood+tariff&y=12&x=18&dateFilterType=yearRange&page=1" %}

In the newspaper “The Day Book”, published October 4, 1913, the author writes about the benefits that this new tariff will have for the average consumer. The tariff, which reduced the duties on most imports, lowered the rates from around 46% to 18%. This allowed the American industry to compete internationally and as a result, the average consumer prices dropped significantly. This new tariff was very popular among the people because it provided higher quality goods at lower pricing.

## The Great Depression and resulting Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act

Before exploring the effects that the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act had on international trade during the 20th century, it’s important to understand the influence of the Great Depression in the formation of this act. The Great Depression was a global economic crisis that occurred from 1929 to 1933. During this time unemployment and lower wages made personal earnings decrease nationwide from eighty-seven billion to forty billion dollars. In addition, approximately five thousand banks failed between 1929 and 1933 and many people lost their life savings.

In order to solve this problem, the American people turned to president Herbert Hoover for potential solutions. Hoover believed that we needed a balanced federal budget and that public relief to citizens would “make them dependent and undermine free enterprise.” (Gilmore, Sugrue). He tried to solve this crisis by creating the Federal Farm Board to buy farm surpluses in the hopes of stopping the decrease in prices. However, this strategy did not function as Hoover had planned because farmers actually increased their production and produced more surplus, which decreased prices even further. As a result, in 1930 congress passed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act.

The purpose of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act was to protect American industries and farmers by raising import duties. David A. Lake, in the book “Power, Protection, and Free Trade” (1988) [^2], indicates that even though the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act contained the highest duty rates in American history, these rates were typically evaluated on a small range of goods and services. As a result, the duty levels on all imports were lower in the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act compared to previous tariffs that were passed during earlier phases of American trade strategy. Four years after the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act was created, an additional Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act was created which resulted in significant policy change by giving the president more power in tariff making authority. This act reversed the projection towards higher tariffs and worked to promoted cooperation with foreign governments and American exports. This pattern for tariff reduction was the precursor to the 1947 General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), an international trade agreement signed by twenty-three countries, including Canada.


{% include feature/pdf.html filename="Nogales International newspaper.pdf" caption="Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act Editorial" link="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn96060774/1932-08-13/ed-1/seq-2/" %}

In the Nogales International Editorial published August 13, 1932, the editorial titled “Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act”, focuses on the Imperial Conference at Ottawa, which was the British Empire Economic Conference to discuss The Great Depression and associated trade restrictions. In the article it is implied that the concept of “imperial preference” will be enacted and will result in discrimination against American manufacturers exports of essential raw materials such as coal, steel and tobacco, which would further reduce the amount of foreign commerce and any increase in the future will be lost. This article is one example of the divide between Republican and Democrat parties over international trade policy. Republicans in general favored continued high import tariffs since they proposed that this would help to save American manufacturers. Democrats argued that higher tariffs were not the right solution and that America should instead try to work cooperatively with other countries for international trade.

## WW2 era and the establishment of the 1947 GATT

Francine McKenzie, in the book “Planning In Cold War Europe” (2018)[^3], states that the purpose of the GATT was to promote trade liberalization by lowering tariffs. As part of the agreement, each member of the GATT was expected to conduct equal trade with other participating countries thus removing trade discrimination. In addition, the GATT significantly reduced tariffs on industrial goods from forty percent in 1947 to less than five percent by 1993. The GATT also played an important role during the Cold war, which began after WWII. Bruce W. Wilkinson, in the article “General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)”,(2006)[^4] states that this agreement had “helped the U.S.-led capitalist west spread its influence by liberalizing trade through multilateral trade agreements.” (Wilkinson). Creating these trade agreements allowed western nations to strengthen their global influence as they were facing the growing threat of communism during the cold war.

After the Cold War, the GATT transitioned into a global organization known as the World Trade Organization (WTO) which came into effect on January 1st, 1995. As of October 2020, 164 countries were members of the WTO and 23 countries were in the process of joining.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, international trade continues to be an important topic even after the 20th century. From the history of tariffs in the United States to the WWII era and the establishment of the 1947 GATT, international trade has continually evolved and remains a relevant aspect in our daily lives. Although we no longer face the growing threat of communism that sprung from the cold war era, it’s important that we continue to strengthen our global influence and create free trade through multilateral trade agreements. By doing this, we not only develop stronger relationships with our allies around the world, we also become better equipped to handle crises at home and abroad.
